# SHEPARD

A minimal Game Boy game.

### Building

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/l0k1/shepard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/l0k1/shepard)

I try to make sure that building works and is error free before pushing to Github. This isn't always the case, however.

I use RGBDS. I don't plan on porting it to WLA.

Dependencies are [RGBDS](https://github.com/bentley/rgbds) and make.

To make:

    cd ./superhappyfunbubbletime/
    make
